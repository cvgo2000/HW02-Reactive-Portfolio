              Hello! My name is Christian Go! I was born and raised in San
              Diego, California. I've lived in Colorado since exiting military
              service with the USMC back in 2001 and have been loving it since!
              While California is my birth state and will always have a special
              place in my heart, I just love the weather variety Colorado
              offers.
            </p>
            <p>
              I currently work in the medical insurance field as a contractor to
              Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, which I've done for the last 10
              years. The decision to get into coding has been a somewhat
              spontaneous move as it is a field I've at the very least had a
              passing interest in. I've got several friends in this line of work
              who encouraged me to follow this path, so here I am!
            </p>
            <p>
              I like to consider myself a weird mixture of traveller and
              homebody. I've visited locales across the United States as well as
              Japan, the Philippines, China and Mexico, but would like to visit
              Austrailia and Europe at some point in my life. My day to day
              hobbies include reading, video games, watching movies and taking
              simple pleasure in sleeping. Thanks for taking the time to visit!
            </p>
