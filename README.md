HW02 - Reactive Portfolio

The purpose of this assignment was to create a portfolio via responsive htmls that linked directly to each other using what we've learned so far in the program using semantic elements in html, styling via CSS, and BootStrap CSS elements to pretty up our pages.  I kept mine simple as I am not yet completely comfortable with the code, but I did find this assignment as fun as it was challenging.
